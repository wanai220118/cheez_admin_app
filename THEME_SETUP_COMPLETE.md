## What's Been Applied

### ✅ Color Theme
Your custom color palette has been applied throughout the app:
- **#B4B0BF** (Light Gray) - Used for borders, dividers, and subtle backgrounds
- **#7E8EAA** (Blue Gray) - Primary color (buttons, app bar, icons)
- **#783D2E** (Dark Brown) - Text color, error states
- **#9B7F5B** (Tan) - Secondary color
- **#B18552** (Golden Brown) - Accent color, FAB

### ✅ Fonts
- **Outfit** - Applied via Google Fonts (works immediately!)
- **Playfair Display** - Used for headings (similar to Mirador, available on Google Fonts)

### ✅ Icons
- Currently using Material Icons (built-in, works perfectly)
- Custom icons are optional (see `ICONS_NEEDED.md` for list)

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the App
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The theme is **already applied** and will work immediately!

### 2. Optional: Add Custom Icons
If you want custom icons, see `ICONS_NEEDED.md` for the list of icons you can download.

### 3. Optional: Use Exact Mirador Font
If you have the Mirador font file and want to use it instead of Playfair Display:
1. Download Mirador font files
2. Place them in `assets/fonts/`
3. Update `lib/utils/app_theme.dart` to use local fonts
