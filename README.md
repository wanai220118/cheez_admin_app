## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.2.0)
- Dart SDK
- Firebase project setup
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cheez_admin_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Add Android app to Firebase project
   - Download `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
   - Place it in `android/app/google-services.json` (this file is gitignored for security)
   - Configure Firebase Auth and Firestore
   - **Important**: Never commit `google-services.json` to version control as it contains sensitive API keys

4. **Environment Variables Setup**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
   - Add your Firebase API keys and configuration:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id_here
     FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
     FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
     FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
     FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
     ```
   - The `.env` file is already added to `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure
   - You can find these values in your Firebase console or `google-services.json` file
   - **Security Note**: The app will throw an error if `.env` is missing - this prevents accidental use of hardcoded keys

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Firebase Configuration

1. **Firestore Database**:
   - Create collections: `products`, `orders`, `customers`, `expenses`, `sales`
   - Set up appropriate security rules
   - Create composite index for `pickupDateTime` field in `orders` collection (required for Order Analysis feature)

2. **Firebase Authentication**:
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
   - Create admin user account

3. **Firestore Security Rules**:
   - Configure rules based on your security requirements
   - Ensure authenticated users can read/write data

## 🔒 Security Features

- Input validation on all forms
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Environment variables for API keys (`.env` file)
- Sensitive files excluded from version control (`.gitignore`)

### ⚠️ Security Best Practices
- **Never commit API keys**: The `.env` file and `google-services.json` are in `.gitignore`
- **Rotate keys if leaked**: If your API keys are exposed, immediately:
  1. Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials
  2. Delete or restrict the exposed API key
  3. Create a new API key with proper restrictions
  4. Update your `.env` file with the new key
  5. Update `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
- **Use API key restrictions**: In Google Cloud Console, restrict your API keys to specific:
  - Android apps (package name + SHA-1)
  - APIs (only Firebase services needed)
  - IP addresses (if applicable)

## 📊 Data Models

## 🎨 Customization

- Replace SVG icons in `assets/icons/`
- Update icon references in code

### Product Images

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase not initialized**

   - Check Firebase configuration in `firebase_options.dart`

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify Firebase Auth is enabled
   - Check email/password format

3. **Data not loading**

   - For Order Analysis: Ensure Firestore composite index for `pickupDateTime` is created (Firestore will provide a link if index is missing)

4. **Image picker not working**
   - Grant storage permissions
   - Check device storage availability

## 📝 Notes

- Product images are stored locally on device (not uploaded to cloud)
- Orders with zero items/pieces/price are automatically filtered out
